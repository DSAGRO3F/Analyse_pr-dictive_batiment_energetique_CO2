Some words in english to tell what subject is about...
The building sector represents 44% of the energy consumed in France, far ahead of the transport sector (31.3%).
Each year, the building sector emits more than 123 million tons of C02, which makes it one of the key areas in the fight against global warming and the energy transition. To make the building more energy efficient, it is necessary to massively renovate the existing one and develop stricter standards in terms of energy consumption for new buildings. This is the purpose of the energy policy in buildings. (https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/energie-dans-batiments). In this context of drastic reduction in the energy consumption of buildings and the equally severe reduction in CO2 emissions, as well as the increase in the cost of energy, the city has for several years taken measurements.
These are expensive. From these readings, are there reliable techniques for estimating consumption and emission levels for buildings not intended for housing and for which we have no measurements?
The statements provided relate to structural data of the buildings (size and use of the buildings, date of construction, geographical location, etc.)
In this study, we are also interested in the "Energy star score" measure for the prediction of emissions. Measure of a tedious approach and one will seek to judge its interest.
Objectives:
Carry out a short exploratory analysis.
Test different prediction models in order to best respond to the problem.
